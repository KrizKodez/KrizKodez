## KrizKodez // Tools and Components

The author is a full-time System Administrator and a part-time Software Developer who probably would never have published anything without the great opportunities of GitHub like this profile or the GitHub Pages.

At the moment I have the following things I'm working on:

- The System Administrator Code of Conduct
- PowerShell Enterprise Scripting Standard
- GPO Best Practices and Naming Standard
- PowerShell Modul CLIOutputDecoder
