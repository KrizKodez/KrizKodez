# KrizKodez // Tools and Components

The author is a full-time System Administrator and a part-time Software Developer who probably would never have published anything without the great opportunities of GitHub like this profile or the GitHub Pages.

## At the moment I have the following things I'm working on:
<p/>

- **The System Administrator Code of Conduct**

  If system administration is more of a craft, what would be the rules to distinguish a good craftsman from a bad one. 
- **PowerShell Enterprise Scripting Standard - PES**

  PowerShell scripting is very powerful and essential but in the most companies there is nothing which domesticates the fantasy of the administrators in writing more or less not maintainable code. This should be a try.
- **[PES Templates](https://github.com/KrizKodez/PESTemplates)**

  PowerShell template files to kick off with the PES-Standard
- **[GPO Best Practices and Naming Standard](https://github.com/KrizKodez/GPONamingStandardBestPractices)**

  GPOs are very important objects to configure endpoints in most of the companies working with Microsoft Active Directory but to avoid an environment which is hard to understand, change or debug the administrator has to follow some rules and use a meaningful naming standard.
- **[PowerShell Module CLIOutputDecoder](https://github.com/KrizKodez/CLIOutputDecoder)**

  A lot of classic CLI tools are still useful but produce only text output. This module converts this text output into PowerShell objects in a declaritive way using so called Decoders (only a bunch of RegExs).

- **[PowerShell Solution UpdateQueryGroup](https://github.com/KrizKodez/UpdateQueryGroup)**

  With this script, the author tries to present a new solution with some new ideas for an old problem, the dynamic updating of groups in the Microsoft Active Directory. The procedure is purely declarative and stored directly in the group object.

- **[PowerShell Solution Delegate GPO Permissions](https://github.com/KrizKodez/DelegateGPOPermissions)**

  The script is a simple solution to delegate permissions for creating and managing Active Directory GPOs to different groups following Least Privilege principle.
